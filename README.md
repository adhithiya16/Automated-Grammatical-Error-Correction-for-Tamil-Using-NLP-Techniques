# Automated-Grammatical-Error-Correction-for-Tamil-Using-NLP-Techniques
This research adopts a new approach to identify and correct Tamil grammar errors by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies. Artificial intelligence heavily relies on NLP, as it has reshaped various domains, including sentiment analysis and machine translation.

The study evaluates the performance, computational accuracy, and practical use of two NLP models operating on two different datasets. Modern machine learning methods are employed to analyze NLLB-200 and MBart concerning their performance when applied to the Tamil Grammar Large Dataset and Error Annotated Tamil Corpus. These datasets provide extensive information about the advantages and weaknesses of the models.

Analytical measurements demonstrate the capabilities of various NLP systems in processing textual information effectively. The results help optimize NLP model deployment in real-world applications, bridging theoretical progress with practical needs. A thorough evaluation of the research contributes to the development of improved NLP methods and fosters breakthroughs in automated language comprehension systems.

The recommendations from this research aim to improve the selection of NLP models and dataset optimization, benefiting the broader field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
