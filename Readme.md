# **Dataset Description: Tamil Grammar Large Dataset**

The **Tamil Grammar Large Dataset** consists of **5,001** entries, designed to support Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Tamil grammar correction. This dataset is a crucial component of our research project, which evaluates the performance of NLP models in identifying and correcting Tamil grammatical errors.  

## **Structure of the Dataset**
The dataset contains three columns:  
1. **Sentence** – A grammatically correct or incorrect Tamil sentence.  
2. **Error Type** – The classification of the grammatical mistake (e.g., **Spelling Error, Subject-Verb Agreement, No Error**).  
3. **Corrected Sentence** – The grammatically correct version of the sentence.  

## **Relevance to Our NLP Project**
- **Error Identification:** The dataset provides various grammatical mistakes, helping to train and evaluate NLP models such as **NLLB-200** and **MBart** in detecting Tamil grammar errors.  
- **Correction Capability:** By including the correct version of each erroneous sentence, the dataset enables supervised learning techniques to improve model accuracy in automatic grammar correction.  
- **Performance Benchmarking:** NLP models can be assessed based on their ability to classify errors and generate corrected outputs, ensuring real-world applicability in Tamil grammar correction systems.  

This dataset plays a vital role in optimizing our NLP model deployment, bridging theoretical advancements with practical applications in Tamil language processing.
